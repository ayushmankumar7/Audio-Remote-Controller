## Objective to the Project

The aim of this project is to connect multiple devices through a common server (ex: WIFI) and play an audio on the child node using the parent node.(Node here refers to the conected devices) <br/>
In layman's term, we want to use our **mobile browsers as remote for playing an audio on the different computer or mobile**. 

## Current State of the project

The **MVP(minimum viable product) of the project is ready**. Now you can setup the project as stated in the project's **README** and test our MVP. Following these steps to run the project. 
```
// Run the following command 
npm start

// Now go to the given link http://localhost:3000. 
// Now find your network's IP address. 
// Enter your IP address on your phone's browser followed by :3000 
// Eg. 192.168.0.102:3000 
// Play with the app, find bugs, potential doable features and open an issue
```

## Types of issues you can work on 

1. **Bug reports** : You may find a bug and know the potential way to solve that bug. 
2. **Feature Request** : You feel that there can be a potential feature, integrate that feature and open a PR. 
3. **Documentation** : The documentation (README, Github Page) changes proposed or you wanna propose.  

## Pull Requests 

When you make a PR, make sure the project builds successfully and your added code doesn't introduce any other bug :). <br/>
While making a PR, add a description on what and how you have solved the issue. 

## Strict Guidelines

1. Don't make a Pull Request unless there is an issue opened. If you want to make a PR then first open an Issue explaining what and why you want to have that change.
2. Fork the repo before working the project.
3. Request for review after making a PR. 
4. Add Screenshots if possible(feature requests) to better explain your problem.
